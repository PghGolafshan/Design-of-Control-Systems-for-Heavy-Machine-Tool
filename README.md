# Design-of-Control-Systems-for-Heavy-Machine-Tool
 Developed a system model and optimized parameters like torque and speed.
## Problem Description

This describes the axis of a heavy machine tool, where the motor drives the lead screw via a reduction gear to move the workpiece to the desired position. Due to the length and flexibility of the lead screw, the torsional effects during power transmission cannot be ignored, and the final position of the system must be controlled considering these effects.
